![Invalid input example](documentation/website-screenshots/14-from-option0-invalid-input-example.png)

**Menu Option 1**

+ **User inputs 1:**

![Menu option 1](documentation/website-screenshots/15-user-selection-option1.png)

*   **Adding Income:** Users can easily record their income for 2025. The application guides them through the process, prompting for:
    *   **Month:** The month the income was earned (e.g., January). The application accepts full month names.
    *   **Source:** The source of the income (e.g., Salary, Freelance).  The application validates that the source is at least 4 characters long and isn't entirely numeric.
    *   **Amount:** The amount earned. The application displays and stores the amount using the standard European currency format (e.g., 1.500,00 EUR).  
    
+ All input fields are required and cannot be left empty. Example below.

![Invalid empty input](documentation/website-screenshots/19-empty-invalid-input.png)

+ Leading/trailing spaces are accepted (e.g., JanuarY, January, january, "    January", etc. are all accepted).

+ Including capitalization to month and source inputs is accepted.

+ The amount must be a positive number (no negative "-" sign accepted).

![amount accepts letter and characters](documentation/website-screenshots/19-amount-accepts-letters-and-characters.png)

+ The amount ideally contains only digits, but to anticipate that an user can make a mistake, special characters or letters are accepted but are removed and not displayed.

+ All invalid inputs are handled with a clear error message. Examples below:

![Invalid month](documentation/website-screenshots/20-invalid-month-name.png)

![Invalid source](documentation/website-screenshots/21-invalid-source-input.png)

![Invalid amount](documentation/website-screenshots/22-invalid-amount-input.png)

+ After entering the details, the application displays a message of the added income (month, source, and amount) confirming that the new income entry has been successfully stored. 

+ Users are then given the option to add another income entry, add an expense entry, return to the main menu, or exit the application. 

![New income data displayed, and the user is prompted for further action](documentation/website-screenshots/16-income-data-added.png)

+ The application validates user input for these options as well, displaying an error message for invalid choices (figure below).

![Invalid option example](documentation/website-screenshots/17-invalid-input-example.png)

+ The new income record is appended (stored) to the my_finances Google cloud "incomes" worksheet (figure below).

![my_finances incomes worksheet](documentation/website-screenshots/18-income-addded-to-google-income-worksheet.png)

**Menu Option 2**

+ **User inputs 2:**

![Menu option 2](documentation/website-screenshots/19-user-selection-option2.png)

+   **Adding Expenses:** Users can easily record their expenses for 2025. The application prompts for the following information:
    -   **Month:** The month the expense was incurred (e.g., January).  Full month names are accepted.
    -   **Category:** The category of the expense.
    Importantly, this input was restricted to a predefined list of categories. This is because the category input is used to calculate the expenses per category and the highest expense. Therefore, data consitency was needed, an this approach resolves the problem with inconsistent category names. 
    The defined categories list is:
      - Housing
      - Transportation
      - Food
      - Personal Care
      - Healthcare
      - Entertainment
      - Shopping
      - Education
      - Travel
      - Gifts
      - Other
    -   **Description:** A description of the expense (e.g., Monthly rent, Weekly groceries). Input must be at least 4 characters long and cannot be entirely numeric. This field allows flexible input to enable users to provide detailed and personalized descriptions of their expenses, as this input is not used for calculations.
    -   **Amount:** The amount spent. The application displays and stores the amount using the standard European currency format (e.g., 1.500,00 EUR). 
  
+ All input fields are required and cannot be left empty.

![Invalid empty input](documentation/website-screenshots/23-empty-invalid-input.png)

+ Leading/trailing spaces to month, category and description inputs is accepted.
(e.g., JanuarY, January, january, "    January", etc.).

+ Including capitalization to month, category and description inputs is accepted.

+ The amount must be a positive number (no negative "-" sign accepted).

+ The amount ideally contains only digits, but to anticipate that an user can make a mistake, special characters or letters are accepted but are removed and not displayed.

+ All invalid inputs are handled with a clear error message. Examples below:

![Invalid month](documentation/website-screenshots/24-invalid-month-input.png)

![Invalid category](documentation/website-screenshots/25-invalid-category-input.png)

![Invalid description](documentation/website-screenshots/26-invalid-description-input.png)

![Invalid amount](documentation/website-screenshots/27-invalid-amount-input.png)

+ After entering the details, the application displays a message of the added expense (month, category, description and amount) confirming that the new expense entry has been successfully stored. 

+ Users are then given the option to add another expense entry, add an income entry, return to the main menu, or exit the application. 

![New expense data displayed, and the user is prompted for further action](documentation/website-screenshots/28-expense-data-added.png)

+ The application validates user input for these options as well, displaying an error message for invalid choices (figure below).

![Invalid option example](documentation/website-screenshots/29-invalid-input-example.png)

+ The new expense record is appended (stored) to the my_finances Google cloud "expenses" worksheet (figure below).

![my_finances expenses worksheet](documentation/website-screenshots/30-expense-added-to-google-income-worksheet.png)

**Menu Option 3**

+ **User inputs 3:**

![Menu option 3](documentation/website-screenshots/31-user-selection-option3.png)

*   **Viewing Income and Expense Data:** Users can view all recorded income or expense data in a tabular format. 

+ The application retrieves the data from the specified worksheet (Incomes or Expenses) and displays it in a well-formatted table.

+ The table includes headers for each column, making the data easy to understand.

![display all income and expense data](documentation/website-screenshots/32-display-all-incomes-and-expenses.png)

+ If there is neither income nor expense data, the application displays a message indicating that no data is available.

![neither income nor expense data](documentation/website-screenshots/32-neither-income-nor-expense-data-to-display.png)

+ If there is income data but no expense data, the application displays a message that "no expenses data has been entered yet"

![display income but no expenses data](documentation/website-screenshots/32-display-income-but-no-expenses-data-yet.png)

+ If there is expenses data but no income data, the application displays a message that "no income data has been entered yet"

![display expenses but no income data](documentation/website-screenshots/32-display-expenses-but-no-income-data-yet.png)

+ The program then asks the user what they would like to do next, and displays the menu options again, with the same validations as in, for example, menu option 0. 

**Menu Option 4**

+ **User inputs 4:**

![Menu option 4](documentation/website-screenshots/33-user-selection-option4.png)

+   **Generating Monthly Finance Reports:** Users can generate detailed financial reports for any month of 2025. The report includes:
    -   **Total Income:**  The sum of all income entries for the selected month, displayed in European currency format.
    -   **Total Expenses:** The sum of all expense entries for the selected month, displayed in European currency format.
    -   **Cash Balance:** The difference between total income and total expenses for the selected month, displayed in European currency format. 
    The application clearly indicates whether the balance is positive or negative.
    ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ Positive Balance!: "cash balance amount EUR"
    ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ Negative Balance!: "cash balance amount EUR"
    -   **Expense Breakdown by Category:** A detailed breakdown of expenses for the selected month, showing the total amount spent in each category, displayed in European currency format.
    -   **Highest Expense Category:** The expense category with the highest total spending for the selected month, also displayed in European currency format.

+ The application first displays the report title in green using colorama to stand out and then prompts the user to enter the month for the report (figure above).

+ Month input field is required and cannot be left empty.

![Invalid empty input](documentation/website-screenshots/34-empty-invalid-input.png)

+ The application validates the user input for the month, ensuring it is a valid month name. Full month names are accepted.

+ Leading/trailing spaces are accepted (e.g., JanuarY, January, january, "    January", etc).

+ If the user enters an invalid month name (e.g., jan, or a misspelled month) an error message is displayed.
![Invalid month](documentation/website-screenshots/35-invalid-month-input.png)

+ If there is neither income nor expense data for the selected month, a message will be displayed indicating there is no data for that month yet.

![Month has no data](documentation/website-screenshots/35-month-has-no-data.png)

+ For a valid month input where there is income data but no expenses data, a warning message will be displayed indicating there is no expense data. In this case, the report displays total income, total expenses (0,00 EUR), cash balance, and in "expenses by category" another warning message that no expenses for this month exists.

![No expense data](documentation/website-screenshots/36-no-expense-data-for-that-month.png)

+ For a valid month input where there is expense data but no income data, a warning message will be displayed indicating there is no income data. In this case, the report displays total income (0,00 EUR), total expenses, cash balance, expenses by category, and highest expense.

![No income data](documentation/website-screenshots/37-no-income-data-for-that-month.png)

+ For a valid month input, where both, income and expenses data exist, the report displays total income, total expenses, cash balance, expenses by category, and the highest expense.

+ For example, if user has the following data:

  + Income data:
  ![Income data](documentation/website-screenshots/39-income-data.png)

  + Expenses data:
  ![Expenses data](documentation/website-screenshots/40-expenses-data.png)

  + The user will obtain the following monthly report:
  ![monthly report](documentation/website-screenshots/41-total-income-and-expenses-calculation.png)

The program then asks the user what they would like to do next, and displays the menu options again, with the same validations as in, for example, menu option 0. 

**Menu Option E**

![Menu option E](documentation/website-screenshots/7-lowercase-valid-input-exit.png)

+ **Exiting the Program:** The application provides a clean exit, displaying a friendly farewell message to the user before closing.
+ This ensures a positive user experience even when leaving the application.
+ Both "e" or E" are recognized as a valid input to exit the program (figures above and below, respectively).

![Menu option E](documentation/website-screenshots/8-uppercase-valid-input-exit.png)

## Features left to implement

+ This project allowed me to apply my understanding of Python, object-oriented programming principles, and core programming concepts like flow control, iteration, conditional statements, functions, methods, and data structures. While I acknowdlege that a complete finance application would include more features (which I intend to add later), my focus here was on these fundamentals. 

+ Among features left to implement:

  +   **Data Editing and Deletion:** Allow users to correct mistakes, or delete their entries, to manage their financial data more effectively.

  +   **Searching:** As the data grows, it will become more difficult to find specific entries. Implementing searching capabilities would allow users to quickly locate the income or expense records they need.

  +   **Data Visualization:** While the monthly report provides a summary, visual representations of the data (charts, graphs) would make it easier for users to understand their spending habits and identify trends.

  +   **Multiple Years:** The application is currently designed to track finances for 2025 only. Future versions could allow users to select the year for tracking.

  +   **Error Handling/Input Validation Improvements:** While basic input validation is implemented, semantic validation of the "source," "category," and "description" fields could be added to further ensure meaningful input. However, to maintain flexibility for users, I have intentionally not implemented strict semantic validation at this stage, as the potential entries for these fields are limitless.

## Design

+ The visual design aims to make the information readily accessible and the interaction intuitive.

+ The use of `colorama` was used to enhance the console output with colored text, improving readability and user experience.

  *   **Green:**  Used for positive messages, success indicators, titles, and section headers (e.g., "WELCOME TO MyFinances APP!", success messages).

  *   **Blue:** Used for prompts, instructions, and menu options. This color is often associated with clarity and trust, making it suitable for guiding the user. (e.g., "Enter your choice (0-4 or E) and press enter:").

  *   **Yellow:** Used for labels and field names, drawing the user's attention to the information they need to provide (e.g., "Month:", "Source:"). Yellow is also used for informational messages, such as the "No income/expenses data found" warning. This distinguishes these messages from errors, which are displayed in red.

  *   **Red:** Used for error messages, drawing the user's attention to invalid input or potential problems. (e.g., "Invalid input: Please enter a number (0-4) or E.").
  Only a few basic colors were used to highlight certain elements:

### Layout

The MyFinances application employs a consistent layout to ensure a predictable and user-friendly experience.

*   **Screen Title/Heading:** Each screen within the application has a clear title or heading, displayed in green and bold. This heading indicates the current section or function the user is interacting with (e.g., "ADD NEW INCOME," "MONTHLY FINANCE REPORT").

*   **Informative Text/Instructions:** Below the heading, most screens provide brief instructions or context-sensitive information relevant to the current task. This guides the user and explains the purpose of the screen. Prominent use of color and bold text is used to distinguish these instructions.

*   **User Input and Prompts:** At the bottom of each screen, the application prompts the user for input. Clear labels are used to indicate the expected input (e.g., "Enter the month name:").  If the user needs to choose from a set of options, these options are presented in a numbered list above the input prompt.  This structure makes it clear what the user needs to do next.

*   **Data Display:**  When displaying data (like income and expenses), the application uses the `tabulate` library to format the information into a clear, tabular format with headers. This makes it easy for users to review their financial records.

## Bugs
+ ### Solved bugs
  1. A call to generate_monthly_finance_report failed because it's a method of the FinanceManager class and required a class instance. However, the call in the handle_user_option was not associated with an instance.
        - Solution: this mistake was spotted and corrected.

  2. The creds.json file dissappeared from the workspace after adding it to 
  .gitignore. It is not clear why that happened, because the .gitignore should just prevent it from being pushed to GitHub. Thus, it should still be present but greyed-out.
      - Solution: I added it back to the workspace and saved it once again.

  3. The application encountered errors when processing amount inputs that included commas (e.g., "1,500"). Direct conversion of these strings to floating-point numbers resulted in a ValueError. 
      - Solution: the code now pre-processes amount strings to remove commas before attempting numerical conversion, ensuring successful calculations.

+ ### Unfixed bugs

There are no known unfixed bugs.

## Deployment

The site was deployed using Heroku following the following steps:
1. Run "pip3 freeze > requirements.txt" in the terminal then commit and push it to GitHub. Make sure you have named this requirements file the same, all lowercase, and check for typos.
2. Get a Heroku account (or log in if you already have one).
3. To create a new app, click "new" (top right) and choose "create new app."
4. Name your app, select a region, and click "Create app."
5. In the "settings" tab, go to Config Vars and press "Reveal Config Vars".
6. In the field for KEY add "CREDS" and into VALUE field copy & paste entire content of creds.json file, and click "Add".
7. Below add another Config Var with KEY = "PORT" & VALUE = "8000".
8. Add Buildpacks: first python and then node.js below. This specific order is crucial.
9. Go to the "Deploy" tab and choose GitHub for Deployment method, click "Connect to GitHub".
10. Search for the repository you would like to deploy and and click on "Connect".
11. Enable either automatic deployment by clicking on the button "Enable Automatic Deploys" in the "Automatic Deploys" Section or deploy a branch manually by selecting the branch and clicking the button "Deploy Branch" in the "Manual deploys" section.
12. Allow the application build process to complete. Then, click the "View" link to access your deployed application.

### Content

- Inspired by my mother, Marcela Rojas, a business administrator, I initially envisioned a personal finance tracker. This evolved, however, into a financial survey to collect and analyze collective income and expense data, as individual tracking proved impractical for a shared dataset.

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_regex.asp) showed me how to use the Regular Expressions (`re`) module.

- [Recursos Python](https://recursospython.com/guias-y-manuales/colorama-texto-fondo-coloreados-la-consola/) showed me how to use the `colorama` library.

- I got further clarificaion on the used of Python Object Oriented Programming from the from the YouTube channel [Bro Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2SGW2VgwAM).

- A list of common expense categories was compiled for this project, drawing inspiration from standard budgeting practices and personal finance resources. Among platforms I researched: [Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Consumer Expenditure Surveys](https://www.bls.gov/cex/) and the [YNAB budgeting app](https://www.ynab.com/).

- [Stack Overflown](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61699115/b-vs-b-in-datetime-module-python-3/) showed me the method for interpreting the month input as a full month name (`datetime.strptime(user_month, "%B")`).
