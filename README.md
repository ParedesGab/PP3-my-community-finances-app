## Features 

### Welcome message

![Welcome message](documentation/website-screenshots/welcome-message.png)
  
+ Positioned above the menu options.
+ The welcome() function displays a colorful welcome message to the user when the program starts. It uses the colorama library to add green borders, creating a visually appealing introduction to the MyFinances app.
+ The welcome message already informs the user what can be done in the program.
       
### Menu options

![Menu options](documentation/website-screenshots/menu-options.png)

+ Displays the 5 menu options.
+ Informs the user what can be done in the program and displays the number to be entered to select the option.
+ It gets the user selection and validates the selection.
+ If the user enters an invalid input (like non-numeric characters) or a number larger than 5, a ValueError is caught, and an error message is displayed (figures below, respectively).

![Invalid choice](documentation/website-screenshots/invalid-literal-for-int.png)

![Invalid choice](documentation/website-screenshots/invalid-choice-not-number-from-1-to-5.png)

+ After any of these errors, the user is prompted to select a menu option (1-5) again.

**Menu Option 1**

![Invalid choice](documentation/website-screenshots/user-selection-option1.png)

+ 1 it is recognized as a valid input.
+ The application first displays the report title in green using colorama to stand out.
+ When generating a monthly report, the application prompts the user for the month name (case-insensitive).
+ If the month is valid, the report displays the total income, total expenses, cash balance, a breakdown of expenses by category, and the highest expense.

  - Calculates Expenses By Category and Highest expense
  ![Invalid choice](documentation/website-screenshots/calculate-expenses-by-category-and-max-spend.png)
  
  - The program then asks the user what they would like to do next, and displays the menu options again (figure below).
  ![Menu options](documentation/website-screenshots/menu-options.png)

+ If the user enters an invalid month name (e.g., jan, or a misspelled month) a ValueError is caught, and an error message is displayed (figure below).

![Menu options](documentation/website-screenshots/invalid-month-name.png)

+ If the entered month is valid but no income or expense data exists for that month, the application displays a message indicating that there is no data for that month yet.
![Menu options](documentation/website-screenshots/month-has-no-data.png)

- The program then asks the user what they would like to do next, and displays the menu options again (figure below). This was intentionally selected because the user might want to view all their data, add a month, etc.

### Game Indications Page

- The user is redirected to this page when clicking to the "Play Instructions" button from the Home Menu page.

- This section provides the user with an introductory explanation of the game, shows visual representations of the game cards, and gives them an option to return to the main menu.

- This section is responsive and the images use the flex-wrap property. 

Design for mobiles:

### Memory Board Game Page

![Memory board game card deck open](documentation/website-screenshots/memory-game-open.png)

It contains two subsections, from top to bottom:

**Subsection: Game Board**

- This section presents the memory game itself: a relaxing and fun memory-matching game designed with a space-related theme.

- Players are challenged to match 8 pairs of cards, with a total of 16 cards in the game.

- The card deck array is created by Javascript within the Game Board section. 

 - The game offers a no-pressure environment where players never lose, ensuring a calm and enjoyable experience.

 - When the game starts (or if it is restarted) the cards will be shuffled and placed face down (**Figure below**), and they have the same hover effect as the home menu buttons. 

![Memory board game card deck closed](documentation/website-screenshots/memory-game-closed.png)

**Subsection: Control Area**
 
 - This subsection displays the "Moves", "Score" and one button, the "Restart Game".

 - These elements are placed on top of the other. 

 - The Restart Game button has the same hover effects as the home menu buttons, and to encourage the user to restart the game as much as they want, the button stands out in orange. 

 - At the beginning of the game:
    - The **Moves** are set to 0, and every time the user chooses two cards, the "moves" will increase by 1.
    - The **Score** is set to 0, and every time there is a match, the player earns 100 points. When the user reaches 800 (i.e., all pairs are matched), the score will show ðŸŽ‰ 800! ðŸŽ‰.

- The Memory Board Game page is responsive. Namely:

  -   The card grid maintains 4 columns and 4 rows across all devices, with the width and height of the cards increasing on larger screens.

  - In tablets and larger screens, the memory card deck and control are placed next to each other (flex-direction: row).

  - In mobiles: the Control Area is placed below the memory card deck. This was achieved because their container (id memory-game-container) was set to display property: flex, and flex-direction: column 

![memory board game mobiles](documentation/website-screenshots/memory-game-mobiles.png)

---
### Game Finished - Congratulations Page

![congratulations page](documentation/website-screenshots/congratulations-message.png)

- After 4 seconds, once the user has matched all the cards (score: ðŸŽ‰ 800! ðŸŽ‰), they are redirected to a page that congratulates them on their victory.

- The congratulations message also stands out in orange.

- In addition, it displays in bold the amount of moves the user made.

- This section contains two buttons:
  - **Home Menu:** Directs you back to to the Home Menu page.
  - **Play again!:** Starts a new game. 

- The buttons use the same style as the home menu buttons. 

- With Javascript, the class smaller-name was added to the header (i.e., game name), to make the whole page more visually organized. 

---
## Features left to implement

- Implement a more dynamic galaxy-themed background (e.g., moving nebulas).

- Add a space-themed sound effect by implementing an event listener in JavaScript that triggers whenever a match occurs.

- Add animations for card flips and matches to enhance the user experience.

- Implement visual feedback (e.g., a highlight) for matched pairs.
- Allow users to navigate back to the home page directly from the memory game. Please note that for now this option was intentionally excluded to encourage players to stay on the game page longer, with the added flexibility to restart the game if they wish.

- I intentionally left out a timer to keep the game relaxed and pressure-free. However, if feedback suggests it, Iâ€™d be happy to implement it with JavaScript.

- Due to time constraints, I used onclick in all buttons of the HTML document for faster implementation. However, I recognize that mixing structure (HTML) with functionality (JS) is not best practice, as it can make the code harder to maintain and does not facilitate collaboration in team environments. After the project is graded, I plan to refactor the code by removing inline onclick attributes, and instead handling events via JavaScript by adding event listeners, ensuring better separation of concerns and improving maintainability.

## Design

### Color scheme

**Main color scheme**

![Main Color scheme](documentation/design/main-color-scheme.png)

- The russian violet (blue), seasalt (white) and davy's gray color where used as the main colors of the website. Their choice was inspired by the universe background image and their used keeps the website cohesive.

- The russian violet (blue) was used for the titles, button names and the paragraph within the Game indications section.

- All buttons except for the button with class btn--restart, used as box shadow the color davy's gray color. 

**Secondary color scheme**

![Secondary Color scheme](documentation/design/secondary-color-scheme.png)

- To simulate colors of the universe the hover effect used two colors as gradient: Royal purple ( #7943af) and Sapphire ( #3455af). 

- The button with the class btn--restart and the congratulatory message are styled in Sinopia orange to ensure that they stand out. This vibrant choice draws attention to the restart option, making it easy for users to replay the game, and highlights the victory message effectively, celebrating the user's success in a visually striking way.

### Typography

- "Rajdhani" and "Roboto" from Google Fonts were used as the primary and secondary font of the website, respectively. 
- The generic family name is "Sans-serif".
- For the titles (h1 and h2) letter-spacing CSS property with a value of 0.3rem was used, to add a slight space between letters in the text.

## Bugs
+ ### Solved bugs
  1. The W3C Markup validation detected the below error in the HTML code:
  ![bug HTML code](documentation/bugs/bug-error-html-code.png)
        - Solution: this mistake was spotted and corrected. 

  2. The W3C Markup validation detected the below warnings in the HTML code:
    ![warnings HTML code](documentation/bugs/bug-warnings-html-code.png)
      - Solution: To enhance the HTML syntax, a hidden H2 heading was added to each section without an existing heading.

  3. JSHint showed the following warning:
    ![warnings JS code](documentation/bugs/bug-warning1-jshint.png)
      - Solution: Although the original code was functioning correctly, the event listener logic was updated to avoid any potentially confusing semantics. A separate click handler function was created. This change ensures the correct card index is captured using a closure for the handleCardFlip function.

+ ### Unfixed bugs

  1. JSHint showed the following warning:

    ![warnings JS code](documentation/bugs/bug-warning2-jshint.png)
    
    - As described in the "Features left to implement" section, due to time constraints, I used onclick in all buttons of the HTML document for faster implementation. However, I recognize that mixing structure (HTML) with functionality (JS) is not best practice, as it can make the code harder to maintain and does not facilitate collaboration in team environments. After the project is graded, I plan to refactor the code by removing inline onclick attributes, and instead handling events via JavaScript by adding event listeners, ensuring better separation of concerns and improving maintainability.
